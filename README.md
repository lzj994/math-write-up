# math-write-up
I share my mathematics work in this repository. Current materials:
1. Probability problems: measure theory based probability problems.
2. Miscellaneous problems: random problems that I think interesting.
3. High Dimensional Probability (in progress): I want to share an selective solution set of the book 'High-Dimensional Probability' by Professor Roman Vershynin. Not sure how far I can go.
